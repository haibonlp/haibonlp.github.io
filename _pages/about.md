I am a Senior Applied Scientist and Science Manager at AWS AI Labs, where I conduct research and production work on **agentic AI** and **large language models (LLMs)**, with an emphasis on the **tool-using agents** and **evaluation**.

My research studies: *how do we build agents that are not only use tools effecitively, but also measurable and reliable?*  
This leads to work on **tool selection and usage**, **offline evaluation**, and **online evaluation** that can assess agent trajectories beyond final-answer accuracy.

## Current Research 

**LLM/Agent Evaluation**
- Training evaluation / judge models
- Offline/build-time evaluation: evalaution metric selection, evaluation data, evaluation pipeline
- Online evaluation: efficient online performance monitoring

**Tool Selection and Optimization** 
- Improving tool selection accuracy
- Tool retrieval modeling
- Tool description optimization

## Background

Previously, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Bosch Research, working on applied ML/NLP problems including dialogue sentiment analysis, customer service understanding, document understanding, and knowledge extraction. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah, where I worked on semi-supervised learning and natural language processing (NLP).
