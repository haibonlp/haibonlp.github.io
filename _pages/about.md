I am a Senior Applied Scientist and Science Manager at AWS AI Labs, where I conduct research and build products in **agentic AI systems** and **large language models (LLMs)**, with a focus on **tool-using agents** and **LLM/agent evaluation**.

My research asks: _How can we build agents that use tools effectively, while remaining measurable, reliable, and robust?_  
This motivates work on **tool selection and tool-use optimization**, and on **offline/online evaluation** that measures **LLM outputs**, **tool calls**, and **agent trajectories**.

## Current Research

### LLM / Agent Evaluation

- Training **evaluator / judge models** for trajectory- and tool-level assessment
- **Offline (build-time) evaluation**: metric design/selection, evaluation datasets, and evaluation pipelines
- **Online evaluation**: efficient performance monitoring and continuous quality measurement

### Tool Selection and Optimization

- Improving **tool selection** accuracy
- **Tool retrieval** modeling
- **Tool description optimization**

## Background

Previously, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Bosch Research, where I built ML/NLP solutions for dialogue sentiment analysis, customer service understanding, document understanding, and knowledge extraction. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah, where I worked on **semi-supervised learning** and **natural language processing**.
